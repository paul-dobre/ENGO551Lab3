This lab displays the GeoJSON retrieved from the City of Calgary API and visualizes it on a leaflet map. The returned data can be searched by issued date with the date range picker widget. The visualization of the map is improved with the markercluster library from here: https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster. This resolves the issue of overlapping markers. The spiderfier (https://github.com/jawj/OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier-Leaflet) was not used as the marker cluster resolved the issue sufficiently.
